# Vertex AI Customer Churn Prediction

🚀 An end-to-end **ML pipeline on Google Cloud Vertex AI**, built to learn the basics of **data engineering + data science workflows in GCP**.  
This project trains a simple model to predict whether a customer/person falls into a **"high income" category (>100K)** (proxy for churn/no churn).  

## 📌 Objectives
- Learn the basics of **Google Cloud Vertex AI** (pipelines, model training, deployment).  
- Practice **Python + ML integration with GCP services**.  
- Showcase an **end-to-end project** for interviews and portfolio.  
- Use **only free resources** within Google Cloud’s free tier.
